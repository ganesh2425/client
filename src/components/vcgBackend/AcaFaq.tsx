                                            <p>Under the Affordable Care Act, certain individuals who apply for health coverage through a Health
                                                Insurance Marketplace are eligible for a government subsidy to help pay for that coverage.</p>
                                            <p>Individuals who are offered health coverage through an employer are eligible for a subsidy only if the
                                                employer's health coverage does not meet certain standards.&nbsp; Information about your employer's health
                                                coverage is required to determine whether or not your employer's coverage meets the established standards
                                                and, based on that finding, whether or not you are eligible for a subsidy.</p>

                                                may be validated, so accuracy is essential.&nbsp; To avoid a potential delay in processing your
                                                Marketplace application, it's important that the employer coverage information is accurate.</p>
